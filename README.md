# JobLister
My first PHP project. Joblister is an app where you can find your dream job!

This app was built with Xampp Stack

# To Use
1. Clone or download the repo
2. Move repo to 'htdocs' Xampp folder and rename to 'joblister'
3. Start Apache and MySql services
4. Go to phpMyAdmin and create database named 'joblister'
5. In SQL Tab, copy & paste initSqlQuery.sql and execute to create database schema

Now you are able to use the app. You can:
- create jobs
- filter jobs by category
- see all jobs
- see job info
- update job
- delete job
